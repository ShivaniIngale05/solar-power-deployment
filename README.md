# Solar Power Prediction Project  

The objective of the project is to build an accurate regression model that can predict solar power output based on environmental and system-related features, and to deploy the trained model as a user-friendly web application.

Project Contents

The Google Drive folder contains the following components:

1. Notebook

P616 : Solar_Power_Prediction.ipynb (Google Colab Notebook)

Includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature selection

Model comparison

Hyperparameter tuning

Final model training and evaluation

---

2. Model & Deployment Files

app.py – Streamlit application file

final_gb_model.pkl – Trained Gradient Boosting Regression model

requirements.txt – Required Python libraries for deployment

final_model_data.csv – Dataset aligned with selected features used by the model

---

3. Presentation

Project_Presentation.pdf / ppt

Contains problem statement, methodology, results, and deployment overview

---

4. Demo Video

Demo Deployment.mp4

Demonstrates the working of the deployed Streamlit application

Deployment

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit

Users can input feature values and get predicted solar power output

Negative power predictions are handled in the application logic

---

How to Access the Project

Open the shared Google Drive folder link

Open the notebook using Google Colab (Colab icon)

View supporting files (dataset, PPT, deployment files, demo video)

Use the Streamlit deployment link (if provided) to test the application

---

Notes

All files are organized systematically for easy review

The notebook is shared as a Colab file for reproducibility and ease of execution
